  "details": "The quickTabUpdateRate setting was removed in v1.6.2.2 because the PointerEvents API now handles update rate automatically. The setting was removed from:\n- popup.html (setting-group div)\n- sidebar/settings.html (setting-group div)\n- popup.js (defaults, load, save)\n- sidebar/settings.js (defaults, load, save)\n\nThe setting allowed users to configure position updates per second (Hz) for dragging, but it is no longer needed.",
