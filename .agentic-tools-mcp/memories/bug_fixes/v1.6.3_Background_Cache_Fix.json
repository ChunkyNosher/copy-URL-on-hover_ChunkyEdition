  "title": "v1.6.3 Background Cache Fix",
  "details": "The background.js hash-based deduplication was causing bugs #1, #2, #6.\n\nFIX: computeStateHash() now includes saveId in hash calculation. The _clearCacheForEmptyStorage() helper always clears cache when tabs array is empty, regardless of hash comparison.\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Hash comparison should NEVER prevent cache updates for empty state. Different saveId = different write = must be acknowledged.",
