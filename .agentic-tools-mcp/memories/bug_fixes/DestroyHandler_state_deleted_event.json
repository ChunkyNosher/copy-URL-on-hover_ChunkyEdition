  "details": "BUG FIX v1.6.3.2: DestroyHandler now emits state:deleted event for manager panel sync.\n\nRoot cause: DestroyHandler.handleDestroy() only emitted QUICK_TAB_CLOSED event (legacy), but PanelContentManager listens for state:deleted event.\n\nFix in DestroyHandler.js:\nAdded _emitStateDeletedEvent() method that emits state:deleted event with { id, quickTab: { id, url, title } }\n\nThis allows the manager panel to update when Quick Tabs are closed from anywhere (not just the panel).",
