  "title": "v1.6.3.3 Critical Bug Fixes",
  "details": "v1.6.3.3 addressed 14 critical Quick Tab bugs:\n\n1. Instance Tracking Loss - Re-register window in quickTabsMap after restore in VisibilityHandler.handleRestore()\n2. Stale Map Entries - Already handled via DOM re-verification in UICoordinator.update()\n3. Delayed Map Cleanup - Already fixed via immediate cleanup in UICoordinator.update()\n4. Z-Index Never Increments - Track _highestZIndex in UICoordinator, apply _getNextZIndex() after restore\n5. DOM Attached Check Returns Truthy Object - Already fixed in v1.6.4.10 (Boolean() wrap in isRendered())\n6. Close Button Doesn't Trigger DestroyHandler - Use internalEventBus for DestroyHandler so state:deleted reaches UICoordinator\n7. Map Never Decrements - Now properly handled via state:deleted event on internal bus to UICoordinator.destroy()\n8. DOM Detaches Post-Restore - Attempt re-render on unexpected detachment in _startDOMMonitoring()\n9. Drag Doesn't Bring Restored Tabs to Front - Enhanced logging to verify onFocus callback wiring\n\nUID Display Bugs:\n1. All UIDs Display Identically - Changed truncation to show LAST N characters (unique random suffix at end)\n2. UID Disappears After Restore - Update showDebugId setting on instance before restore render\n3. \"Tab not found\" Warnings - Remove spurious warnings that fire during successful operations\n4. Duplicate Iframe Processing Logs - Already minimal, no changes needed\n5. Settings Loading Desync - Make UICoordinator use same storage source as CreateHandler (storage.local with 'quickTabShowDebugId' key)\n\nKey Event Bus Fix: DestroyHandler was using external eventBus but UICoordinator listens on internalEventBus. Fixed by passing internalEventBus to DestroyHandler.",
