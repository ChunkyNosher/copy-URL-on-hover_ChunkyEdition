  "details": "Since v1.6.0.12, Quick Tabs are stored in browser.storage.local (not storage.sync) to avoid quota limits. Since v1.6.2.2, the storage format is unified (single tabs array) not container-based. The sidebar/quick-tabs-manager.js was fixed in v1.6.3 to read from storage.local and parse the unified format. StateManager.js now calls persistToStorage() after add/update/delete/clear operations for cross-context sync via storage.onChanged events.",
