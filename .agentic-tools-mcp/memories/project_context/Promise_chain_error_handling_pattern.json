  "title": "Promise chain error handling pattern",
  "details": "In the queueStorageWrite() function in src/utils/storage-utils.js, Promise chain failures should be handled by returning false (success indicator) rather than Promise.reject(). Returning a rejected promise while simultaneously resetting the module-level storageWriteQueuePromise variable creates orphaned rejections - the caller receives the old rejected promise while the new queue has moved on. The fix is to resolve gracefully with a failure indicator (false) instead of rejecting.",
