  "details": "Quick Tabs storage location is browser.storage.local (not storage.sync) since v1.6.0.12 due to quota limits. All sidebar and manager code must use storage.local for Quick Tab state. The unified format (v1.6.2.2+) is: { tabs: [...], saveId: '...', timestamp: ... }. Container-based format is deprecated. StateManager.persistToStorage() writes to storage.local after add/update/delete/clear operations.",
