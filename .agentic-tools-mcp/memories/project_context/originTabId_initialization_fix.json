  "title": "originTabId initialization fix",
  "details": "QuickTabWindow class must initialize originTabId from constructor options in _initializeVisibility() method. Without this initialization, originTabId becomes undefined on instances and then null when serialized to storage, breaking cross-tab isolation. The fix is: this.originTabId = options.originTabId ?? null; following the same pattern as currentTabId. This was identified in v1.6.3.7-v3. Related file: src/features/quick-tabs/window.js",
