  "details": "## ReactiveQuickTab Implementation Pattern (v1.6.2.1)\n\n### Key Learnings for Proxy Reactivity:\n\n1. **Capture old computed values BEFORE data changes**\n   - When a data property changes in the Proxy set handler, computed properties that depend on it need to notify watchers with the OLD value\n   - The `_captureAffectedComputedValues()` method must be called BEFORE `obj[prop] = value`\n   - Otherwise, when computing the \"old\" value, the data has already changed, giving the new value\n\n2. **Computed Property Caching with Dependency Tracking**\n   - Use `_dependencies` Map to track which computed properties depend on which data properties\n   - Use `_computedCache` Map to cache computed values\n   - Use `_computedDirty` Set to mark which computed properties need recomputation\n   - Invalidate affected computed properties when dependencies change\n\n3. **Validation Pattern (No Exceptions)**\n   - Use static `_validators` object with validation functions\n   - Use static `_validatorMap` to map property names to validator types\n   - Return boolean from `_validate()`, don't throw\n   - Log warning and continue on invalid values (graceful degradation)\n\n4. **ESLint Complexity Reduction Patterns**\n   - Extract validation logic into static maps to reduce cyclomatic complexity\n   - Use early return with `continue` instead of nested `if` blocks\n   - Extract helper methods like `_getOldComputedValue()` and `_invalidateSingleComputed()`\n   - Use helper like `_getNumber()` to reduce ternary expressions\n\n5. **Solo/Mute Mutual Exclusion**\n   - When setting solo with non-empty array, clear mute\n   - When setting mute with non-empty array, clear solo\n   - Must capture old values BEFORE clearing the other property\n   - Notify watchers about the cleared property\n   - Also invalidate computed properties that depend on the cleared property",
