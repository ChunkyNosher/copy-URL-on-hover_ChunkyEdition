  "details": "The copy-URL-on-hover_ChunkyEdition extension uses version tags in console.log messages to document when features were introduced. When refactoring existing code:\n- Keep original version tags in log messages (they document feature introduction)\n- Update docstrings with new version info\n- Update file headers with new version info\n\nExample: _executeWithScriptingFallback() was introduced in v1.6.3.10-v4 and refactored in v1.6.3.10-v5. The log messages keep v4 tags, but docstrings note v5 changes.",
