  "title": "Look-Ahead Pattern for Map Updates",
  "details": "UICoordinator._handleDetachedDOMUpdate() uses look-ahead pattern: determine final state (willRender) BEFORE modifying Map. Only delete from renderedTabs when final state is minimized. This prevents the 'deleted but about to recreate' intermediate state that caused 73-second log gaps. Pattern: const willRender = !entityMinimized &amp;&amp; (!instanceMinimized || isRestoreOperation);",
