  "details": "All handler methods in QuickTabHandler.js must call `await this._ensureInitialized()` as their first operation to prevent race conditions during browser startup. The _ensureInitialized() method validates both `this.isInitialized` flag AND `this._isGlobalStateReady()` (checks Array.isArray(globalState.tabs)) to ensure storage has been loaded. Use [InitBoundary] log prefix for initialization state changes.",
