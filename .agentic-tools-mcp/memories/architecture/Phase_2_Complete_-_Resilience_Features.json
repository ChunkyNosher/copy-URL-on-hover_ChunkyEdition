  "content": "Successfully completed Phase 2: Reliability (Gaps 1 & 2 of test-to-prod implementation).\n\n**Gap 1: Storage-Based Fallback (16 tests)**\n- Automatic fallback when BroadcastChannel unavailable\n- storage.onChanged listener for message propagation\n- Storage-based broadcasting with timestamp keys\n- Periodic cleanup (5s TTL)\n\n**Gap 2: Error Recovery & Reconnection (17 tests)**\n- Health tracking (lastSuccessfulSend, consecutiveFailures)\n- Automatic reconnection after 3 failures\n- Exponential backoff: 100ms, 500ms, 2s, 5s, 5s\n- Error event emission (broadcast:error)\n- Manual channel health test\n- Falls back to storage after 5 failed reconnections\n- Timer cleanup on close\n\n**Total Phase 2:** 33 tests passing\n\n**Key Design Decisions:**\n- FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 3 (trigger reconnection)\n- MAX_RECONNECTION_ATTEMPTS = 5 (switch to fallback)\n- Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming system\n- Health test uses __PING__ message\n- Error events include failure count and timestamp\n\n**Self-Healing Architecture:**\n1. Track health: lastSuccessfulSend, consecutiveFailures, isChannelHealthy\n2. Detect failures: Increment failure count on error\n3. Trigger recovery: Schedule reconnection at threshold\n4. Exponential backoff: Prevent rapid reconnection attempts\n5. Ultimate fallback: Switch to storage after max attempts\n\n**Next:** Phase 3 - Observability (Gaps 7 & 4)\n\n**Total Progress:** 92 tests (Phase 1: 59 + Phase 2: 33)",
