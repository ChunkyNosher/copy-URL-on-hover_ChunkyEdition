  "title": "Storage retry and operation lock patterns",
  "details": "v1.6.3.10-v6 introduced key patterns:\n\n1. Storage retry logic: Exponential backoff (100ms, 500ms, 1000ms) for failed writes. Use _attemptStorageWrite() for individual attempts, _handleSuccessfulWrite() for success cleanup.\n\n2. Operation lock timeout: 2000ms (OPERATION_LOCK_MS) - matches STORAGE_TIMEOUT_MS for consistency. Used in mediator.js for minimize/restore/destroy locks.\n\n3. Snapshot expiration: 1000ms (PENDING_SNAPSHOT_EXPIRATION_MS) for pending snapshots in MinimizedManager. Auto-cleanup prevents memory leaks.\n\n4. Race condition prevention: UpdateHandler._isTabMinimized() check before persist prevents stale position data from being written during debounce window after minimize.",
