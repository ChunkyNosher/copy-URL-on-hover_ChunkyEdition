  "details": "UICoordinator.js properly imports createQuickTabWindow from '../window.js' as an ES module. The previous /* global createQuickTabWindow */ comment was just a JSLint directive that didn't actually import anything - it was replaced with proper import in Issue #35 fix. Tests should use jest.mock() to mock the window.js module rather than setting global.createQuickTabWindow.",
