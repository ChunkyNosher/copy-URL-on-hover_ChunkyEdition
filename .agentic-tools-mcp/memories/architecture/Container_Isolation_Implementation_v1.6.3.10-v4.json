  "title": "Container Isolation Implementation v1.6.3.10-v4",
  "details": "Container isolation for Firefox Multi-Account Containers was implemented in v1.6.3.10-v4. Quick Tabs now track `originContainerId` field in addition to `originTabId`. The container ID is captured from `options.originContainerId`, `options.cookieStoreId`, or `this.cookieStoreId` during Quick Tab creation. UICoordinator and QuickTabsManager both check container match in `_shouldRenderOnThisTab()`. Storage serialization includes `originContainerId`. MinimizedManager snapshots preserve `savedOriginContainerId`. Container check returns true if no container context was set (backward compatibility).",
