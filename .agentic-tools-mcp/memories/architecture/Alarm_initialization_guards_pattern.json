  "title": "Alarm initialization guards pattern",
  "details": "v1.6.3.8-v5 introduced initialization guards for browser.alarms handlers in background.js:\n\n1. All non-keepalive alarms (cleanup-orphaned, sync-session-state, diagnostic-snapshot) check `isInitialized` before execution and skip safely if false\n2. Keepalive alarm handler `_handleKeepaliveAlarm()` only sends sidebar pings after initialization\n3. `_sendAlivePingToSidebars()` uses optional chaining on globalQuickTabState for defensive safety\n4. Skipped alarms log with ALARM_SKIPPED_NOT_INITIALIZED for debugging\n\nPattern: Always check `isInitialized` in alarm handlers that access globalQuickTabState or perform storage operations.",
