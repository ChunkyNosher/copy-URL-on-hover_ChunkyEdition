  "title": "Object Pool Pattern for UI Elements",
  "details": "Phase 3D Optimization implemented QuickTabUIObjectPool.js in sidebar/utils/ for reusable UI elements. Pattern: pre-allocate 50-100 elements, acquire() from pool, release() to return. Pool tracks hits/misses/resizes. Expected 60-80% reduction in GC pause times. Key constants: DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE=75, MIN_POOL_SIZE=50, MAX_POOL_SIZE=200, POOL_GROWTH_FACTOR=1.5. Elements have base structure with qt-favicon, qt-title, qt-url, qt-actions containers. _resetElement() clears data attributes, styles, and child content while preserving structure.",
