  "content": "Fixed the release.yml workflow Chrome package verification logic. The issue was incorrect handling of grep exit codes:\n\nPROBLEM:\n- grep -q returns exit code 0 when pattern IS found, 1 when NOT found\n- The old code used: `grep -q \"browser_specific_settings\"; if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo SUCCESS`\n- This logic was inverted: non-zero exit code (pattern not found) was treated as failure\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Changed to: `if grep -q \"browser_specific_settings\"; then echo WARNING; else echo SUCCESS; fi`\n- Now correctly handles: exit code 0 (found) = warning, exit code 1 (not found) = success\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Tested locally with both Firefox and Chrome manifests\n- Triggered workflow via workflow_dispatch - Chrome verification step passed ✓\n- Firefox manifest correctly contains browser_specific_settings (found)\n- Chrome manifest correctly excludes browser_specific_settings (not found)\n\nFILE: .github/workflows/release.yml, lines 166-172",
