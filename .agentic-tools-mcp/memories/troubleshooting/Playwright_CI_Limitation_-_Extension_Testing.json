  "title": "Playwright CI Limitation - Extension Testing",
  "details": "Critical limitation discovered: Playwright extension tests cannot run in GitHub Actions CI environment.\n\nROOT CAUSE: chromium.launchPersistentContext() hangs indefinitely in Xvfb virtual display environment when loading browser extensions. This is a known Playwright issue (#28336, #15953) with no reliable workaround.\n\nWHY IT HAPPENS:\n1. Extensions require launchPersistentContext (not regular launch)\n2. Extensions require headless: false mode\n3. CI uses Xvfb for virtual display\n4. Chromium + persistent context + Xvfb = incompatibility\n\nATTEMPTED FIXES (all failed):\n- Increased timeouts (60s → 180s)\n- Simplified Chrome args\n- Session state cleanup\n- Extension path validation\n- Debug logging\n\nVERIFICATION: Extension files are correct, Xvfb is running, DISPLAY is set. The hang happens inside Chromium's launch process before any timeout can trigger.\n\nSOLUTION: Manual testing required for Issue #47 scenarios. Automated browser extension testing in CI is not feasible with current Playwright + GitHub Actions setup.\n\nALTERNATIVES FOR FUTURE:\n1. Local testing with real display\n2. Unit tests for business logic (no browser)\n3. Different CI platform (CircleCI, BrowserStack)\n4. Self-hosted runner with real display\n\nThis is an infrastructure limitation, not a code bug.",
