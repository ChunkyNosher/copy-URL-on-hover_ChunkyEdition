  "title": "Playwright Firefox Extension Testing Limitation",
  "details": "Playwright (as of v1.56.1) does not natively support automated Firefox extension loading like it does for Chromium. This is a fundamental limitation that affects automated testing.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n1. **Chromium**: Extensions load via `--load-extension` command-line argument (works perfectly in automated tests)\n2. **Firefox**: Requires remote debugging protocol + manual installation OR pre-installed profile with `--pre-install` flag\n3. **playwright-webextext**: Community library that wraps Firefox's remote debugging protocol, but is outdated (requires Playwright 1.26.0, incompatible with 1.56.1)\n\n**Impact on Testing:**\n- Automated test suites (npm run test:extension:firefox) cannot easily test Firefox extensions\n- Firefox extensions must be manually loaded via `about:debugging` or pre-installed in profile\n- Playwright MCPs can work IF extension is pre-loaded in Firefox profile\n\n**Workarounds:**\n1. **web-ext with --pre-install**: `npx web-ext run --source-dir=dist --firefox-profile=./firefox-profile --pre-install --keep-profile-changes`\n2. **Manual loading**: Use `about:debugging` to load temporary extension before running Playwright tests\n3. **Focus on Chromium**: Test all scenarios in Chromium which has full support\n\n**Solution for This Project:**\n- Use Chromium Playwright MCP for automated testing of scenarios 1-7 and 9\n- Document Firefox testing as manual verification process\n- Future: Consider upvoting https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/7297 for native Firefox support",
