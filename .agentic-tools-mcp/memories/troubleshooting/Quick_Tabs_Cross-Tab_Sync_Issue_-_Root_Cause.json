  "details": "## Root Cause Analysis of Quick Tabs Bugs\n\nFrom analyzing logs `copy-url-extension-logs_v1.6.1_2025-11-22T03-30-53.txt` and `copy-url-extension-logs_v1.6.1_2025-11-22T03-46-41.txt`:\n\n### Problem 1: Tab Switching Doesn't Load Quick Tabs\nWhen user switches between tabs:\n1. Quick Tabs created in Tab 1 (wikipedia) with firefox-default container\n2. Switch to Tab 2 - logs show it's in firefox-container-9\n3. SessionStorageAdapter fails: \"can't access property \\\"get\\\", e.storage.session is undefined\"\n4. StorageManager logs: \"No data found for container firefox-container-9\"\n5. StateManager hydrates 0 Quick Tabs - so nothing renders!\n\n**Issue**: Different tabs have different containers (firefox-default vs firefox-container-9), and the storage lookup is container-specific. Quick Tabs created in firefox-default container are NOT being loaded when switching to tabs in different containers.\n\n### Expected Behavior (from Issue #47)\nPer Scenario 1 and 2 in Issue #47:\n- Quick Tabs should be visible across ALL tabs regardless of container\n- Position/size changes in ANY tab should sync to ALL other tabs\n- Closing in ANY tab should remove from ALL tabs\n\n### Current Broken Behavior\n- Container isolation is TOO strict\n- Quick Tabs are only visible within the same container they were created in\n- Cross-container visibility is completely broken\n\n### The Fix Required\nQuick Tabs should be GLOBAL across all tabs, NOT container-isolated. The current implementation treats each container as a separate workspace, but Issue #47 clearly shows Quick Tabs should sync across ALL tabs.\n\n**Storage Strategy**: Quick Tabs should be stored in a global storage key, not per-container. Container ID can be stored as metadata, but lookup should be global.\n\n**BroadcastChannel Strategy**: Either use a global channel OR listen to multiple container channels, but state should be shared globally.",
