  "title": "Debug UID Display Dynamic Update Fix",
  "details": "Fixed Quick Tabs Debug UID Display feature (v1.6.4.8). The feature was completely non-functional due to 4 issues. Issue #4 (no dynamic updates) was the critical missing piece - added storage.onChanged listener in CreateHandler._setupStorageListener() that calls _updateAllQuickTabsDebugDisplay() to update already-rendered Quick Tab titlebars when the quickTabShowDebugId setting changes. Added updateDebugIdDisplay(showDebugId) method in both TitlebarBuilder (with _addDebugIdElement/_removeDebugIdElement helpers) and QuickTabWindow to dynamically add/remove UID elements without recreating the Quick Tab.",
