  "title": "Firefox sidebarAction.toggle() API",
  "details": "Firefox provides a built-in `browser.sidebarAction.toggle()` method (added in Firefox 73) that directly toggles the sidebar open/close state. This is cleaner than checking `isOpen()` and then calling `open()` or `close()`. For older Firefox versions, fall back to `open()` only.\n\nWhen sending messages to a newly-opened sidebar, the sidebar needs time to initialize (DOM ready + scripts loaded). A delay of 300ms is recommended, with retry logic (3 attempts, 150ms apart) for reliable message delivery.",
