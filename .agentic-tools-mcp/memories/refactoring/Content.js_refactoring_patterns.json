  "title": "Content.js refactoring patterns",
  "details": "Refactored content.js from CodeScene score 8.55 to 9.09 using these patterns:\n\n1. Extract complex conditionals into named boolean helper functions\n2. Use wrapper functions to reduce duplication in similar handlers\n3. Use dispatcher pattern (ACTION_HANDLERS/TYPE_HANDLERS maps) to replace large if-chain\n4. Extract logging arguments into helper functions to reduce cc from optional chaining operators\n5. Generic handler wrappers (_wrapSyncTestHandler, _wrapAsyncTestHandler) reduce boilerplate in test bridge handlers\n\nTrade-off: Extracting functions reduces cyclomatic complexity but increases function count, which can trigger \"Brain Class\" warnings. Balance is needed.",
