  "content": "VERIFICATION: Export Filter Application Already Implemented\n\nThe analysis document inferred export filters might not be working, but code review confirmed they ARE fully implemented:\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n1. popup.js: filterLogsByExportSettings() function (lines 323-335)\n   - Filters logs by checking category against export settings\n   - Fail-safe for uncategorized logs (always included)\n\n2. popup.js: exportAllLogs() function (lines 369-380)\n   - Gets export filter settings from storage\n   - Applies filter to all collected logs\n   - Logs before/after counts and percentage\n\n3. Integration: Called in export workflow before generating file\n\nPATTERN: Synchronous filtering with fail-safe defaults\nSTATUS: ✅ Already working correctly\nNO FIX NEEDED: Just verification\n\nBoth live console AND export filters were already properly implemented despite user concerns. The actual issue was keyboard logging noise making debugging difficult to verify the filters were working.",
