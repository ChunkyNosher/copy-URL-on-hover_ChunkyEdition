  "content": "VERIFICATION: Live Console Filter Broadcasting Already Implemented\n\nThe comprehensive analysis document suggested the live console filter wasn't working, but code review revealed it WAS already correctly implemented:\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n1. popup.js: refreshLiveConsoleFiltersInAllTabs() function (lines 1131-1147)\n   - Queries all tabs\n   - Sends REFRESH_LIVE_CONSOLE_FILTERS message to each tab\n   - Handles errors gracefully (tabs without content scripts)\n\n2. content.js: Message handler (lines 1094-1109)\n   - Listens for REFRESH_LIVE_CONSOLE_FILTERS\n   - Calls refreshLiveConsoleSettings() from logger.js\n   - Updates cache immediately\n\n3. Called from saveFilterSettings() after saving to storage (line 1095)\n\nPATTERN: Message-based cache invalidation across all content scripts\nSTATUS: ✅ Already working correctly\nNO FIX NEEDED: Just verification that architecture is sound\n\nThis demonstrates importance of code review before implementing \"fixes\"",
