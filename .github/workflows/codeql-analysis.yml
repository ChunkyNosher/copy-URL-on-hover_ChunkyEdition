name: "CodeQL Security Analysis"

# WHEN THIS RUNS:
# - On every push to main branch
# - On every pull request
# - Weekly on Monday at 6am (to catch new vulnerability patterns)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 6am UTC

# WHAT IT DOES:
# Scans JavaScript code for security vulnerabilities, logic bugs, and unsafe patterns
# GitHub Copilot natively integrates with CodeQL results
# DeepSource also has security checks but CodeQL is more comprehensive

        # This uploads results to GitHub Security tab
        # Copilot Code Review automatically reads these results

# RESULT:
# - Security alerts appear in GitHub Security tab
# - Copilot sees vulnerabilities and explains them in PR reviews
# - DeepSource may flag the same issues - Copilot deduplicates
# - Copilot suggests secure alternatives
