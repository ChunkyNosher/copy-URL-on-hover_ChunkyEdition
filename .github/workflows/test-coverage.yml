      # IMPORTANT: DeepSource automatically reads coverage/lcov.info
      # No additional upload step needed - it detects the file automatically

# HOW COPILOT + DEEPSOURCE USE THIS:
# 1. Codecov posts PR comment: "Coverage decreased by 2.3%"
# 2. DeepSource analyzes which specific lines aren't covered
# 3. Copilot reads both sources and combines insights:
#    "Coverage dropped in state-manager.js lines 45-67.
#    These lines handle container isolation logic and are critical.
#    DeepSource analysis shows they're also complex (CC=12).
#    Suggested tests: [generates test cases]"
