        # The [skip ci] prevents infinite loop of formatting runs

# NOTE: DeepSource also has Autofix™ AI that can fix style + logic issues
# This Prettier workflow is faster for formatting-only changes
# DeepSource Autofix handles more complex issues like refactoring

# HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER:
# 1. Prettier (this workflow): Fixes formatting in <1 minute
# 2. DeepSource Autofix AI: Creates separate PR for logic/quality issues
# 3. Copilot: Reviews both sets of changes and suggests improvements
